                        the authors of the novel statistical method and co-author of the PredTest package. I turned his ideas into open-source software.

                        Global hypothesis tests combine information across multiple endpoints to

                        The prediction test</a> (Montgomery and Mahnken, 2020) is a recently proposed global hypothesis test with good 
                        performance for small sample sizes and many endpoints of interest. The test is also flexible in 
                        the types and combinations of expected results across the individual endpoints. This package 
                        provides functions for data processing and calculation of the prediction test.

                        I used Python to clean all possible scores from multiple Excel files, created an easy to filter JSON file 
                        containing over 55,000 rows of data, unit tested the model in Python, then converted it to JavaScript to quickly 
                        develop an Android and iOS App in ReactNative. The current version uses a subclass of the original model for the 
                        calculations. I plan to update the app using SQLite to allow leaders to not only easily calculate individual scores,
                        but store and email entire unit's soldiers data in an Excel file to track unit physical readiness.

                            The ACFT consists of six events: three-rep max deadlift, the standing power throw of a 10 lbs 
                            medicine ball, hand release pushups in two minutes, the sprint drag carry timed obstacle, 
                            timed plank, and the two mile run, which can be replaced with alternative cardiovascular, 
                            such as biking, swimming, rowing, and walking. There are different scales based on age and gender 
                            for the scoring of the ACFT. A max score is 600 and soldiers must pass with at least 60 points 
                            in each event.
